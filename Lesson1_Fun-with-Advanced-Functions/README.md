# Terraform Fun with Advanced Functions

This tutorial simplifies the learning process for beginners by demonstrating advanced Terraform functions through a straightforward project. By working on this local project, you will gain hands-on experience with key functions without needing cloud credentials.

## Advanced Terraform Functions Covered

1. **`for_each`**: Iterates over a map or set of strings to create multiple resources or modules.
2. **`for`**: Iterates over a list or map to produce a new list or map.
3. **`yamldecode`**: Decodes a YAML string into a Terraform map.
4. **`regex`**: Applies a regular expression to a string and returns the matching substring.
5. **`format`**: Formats a string using a template and values.
6. **`formatdate`**: Formats a timestamp according to a specified layout.
7. **`try`**: Attempts to evaluate an expression and returns a fallback value if it fails.
8. **`coalesce`**: Returns the first non-null value from a list of arguments.
9. **`flatten`**: Flattens a list of lists into a single list.
10. **`join`**: Concatenates elements of a list into a single string with a specified delimiter.
11. **`toset`**: Converts a list to a set, removing duplicate values.
12. **`contains`**: Checks if a list contains a specific element.
13. **`file`**: Reads the contents of a file into a string.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Install Terraform**: Ensure you have Terraform installed on your machine. This project supports from terrafor >= 1.0 version.

2. **Prepare the Project Directory**: Clone this repository in your local.

3. **Initialize the Project**:
    - Run `terraform init` to initialize the project and download necessary providers.

4. **Apply the Configuration**:
    - Run `terraform apply` to apply the configuration. You will be prompted to confirm the action by typing `yes`.
    - Terraform will read the input YAML file, process the data, and generate a story text file with a timestamped filename.

5. **Review the Output**:
    - Check the generated story file in your project directory. The filename will be in the format `output_YYYYMMDD.txt`.
    - Review the console output for success messages generated by the `null_resource`.

By following these steps, you will learn how to use advanced Terraform functions to manipulate data and generate dynamic content.
